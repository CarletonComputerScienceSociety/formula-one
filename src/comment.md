# Comments

We can make comments in a certain python program to make it easier for the programmer and the reader. We can use the symbol # and make comments.

```python
#Introduction to Python
x = 105
```

We can also make multiline comments by using triple double quotes. 

```python
"""
This way we can create multiline
comments in a particular python 
program.
