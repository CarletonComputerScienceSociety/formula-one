# Python Setup

Most of the computers sold today have a pre-installed version of python. But as the Carleton computer science community, we installed the software named as WING 101.

## WING 101 INSTALLATION PROCESS:

1. The most recent software can be found on the webpage linked here [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- For windows operating systems, download the **Windows x86-64 executable installer.**
- For macOS or any newer release, there is only one installer available on the website.

  2.  After clicking the website for downloading the python software, click to go to the page of downloads.

  3.  Use the newest version of the software that is available on the webpage.

  4.  Click on the newest version, and scroll down to the bottom of the page (where there a list of links you can download from).

  5.  Download Windows x80-64 executable installer and for mac users, use the appropriate mac       installers. 

  6.  Double click on the downloaded file from the file manager. 

  7.  Once the application has opened, **DONT FORGET TO ADD PATH TO THE INSTALLATION PROCESS**, and then click install.
