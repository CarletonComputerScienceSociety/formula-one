A guide for the first-year students at the Carleton department of Bachelor of Computer Science. It highlights all of the necessary skills and tools to be aware of as an incoming student and most importantly, it is an opportunity for such students to be exposed to similar material namely COMP 1405 and COMP 1406 to that of the course materials. (NOTE: This is not a replacement for any of the course materials/lectures; it is simply a way to get familiarized with the programming skill beforehand, to avoid a blank state of mind during class.
