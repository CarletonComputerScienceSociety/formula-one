# Formula One

We are a team of young, passionate students who have recently begun our journey
at Carleton and are looking for ways to give back to the community. From this
idea, Formula One was born.

## A Guide for First-Year Computer Science Students at Carleton

Formula One is a guide for first-year students in the Carleton Bachelor of
Computer Science department. It highlights all of the necessary skills and tools
that incoming students should be aware of, and provides an opportunity for
students to familiarize themselves with programming material, such as COMP 1405
and COMP 1406. Note that this is not a replacement for any course materials or
lectures; it is simply a way to get a head start and avoid a blank state of mind
during class.
